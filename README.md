# Floppy Sound Emulator

This Buildroot package installs a binary that plays a sample of a floppy drive head step whenever a GPIO pin pulse is received. ALSA is used to play the sound. Used in the [Amiga Floppy Selector](https://github.com/JetA2/afs_server) project to bring back the floppy sound after moving to a floppy emulator.
